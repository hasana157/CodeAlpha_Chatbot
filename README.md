# CodeAlpha_ChatbotIntelligent Chatbot – Java Project
📚 Description
This project is a console-based intelligent chatbot developed using Java.
It interacts with users in natural language, responding based on keyword detection to simulate a basic AI conversation.
The chatbot is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and demonstrates core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (OOP principles)

Java Standard Library (Scanner Class)

Basic Natural Language Processing (keyword matching)

Console I/O

🎯 Features
Friendly greeting and interaction.

Recognizes common conversational phrases (e.g., greetings, help, weather, thanks, farewell).

Case-insensitive input handling.

Graceful conversation flow.
